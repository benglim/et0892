Hi everyone. I recently joined Singapore Polytechnic as an Adjunct Lecturer. Before that I worked my way from a techncal engineer to that of CIO in several organisations. I hope my working experience will be of benefit in my interactions with you.

I am glad that all of you have taken the step to upgrade yourselves. You have to sacrifice a fair bit by embarking on this journey, but I assure you the benefits will far outweight the alternative.

During the course of the academic term, I will follow closely the curriculum as outlined in PoliteMall. However, there will be activities beyond the course whicch I hope will add some variety to the dry subject of Data Analytics. I welcome feedback on what other things you would like to see.

I hope to communicate with you further outside classroom hours through this offline media: blogs. Feel free to contact me.

Regards
Beng Lim
