Hi everyone. I recently joined Singapore Polytechnic as an Adjunct Lecturer. Before that I worked my way from a techncal engineer to that of CIO in several organisations. I hope my working experience will be of benefit in my interactions with you.

I am glad that all of you have taken the step to upgrade yourselves. You have to sacrifice a fair bit by embarking on this journey, but I assure you the benefits will far outweight the alternative.

During the course of the academic term, I will follow closely the curriculum as outlined in PoliteMall. However, there will be activities beyond the course whicch I hope will add some variety to the dry subject of Data Analytics. I welcome feedback on what other things you would like to see.

I hope to communicate with you further outside classroom hours through this offline media: blogs. Feel free to contact me.

Regards
Beng Lim

### Notes for the Week

I will be posting updated notes which you can download from here. I have removed the narration as it disrupts the presentation flow during class. The narration by the original course instructor may be quite useful, so go to POLITEMall to get them if necessary.
