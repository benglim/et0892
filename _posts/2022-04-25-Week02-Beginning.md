Hi all. We are starting now on the second week of lessons. Last week was quite easy going as we have not actually touched on the major aspects of Data Analytics. In the coming weeks, the materials will be getting more technical, so it will rely a bit more on your Mathematics background. But don't be too discouraged as we just need you to grasp the key concepts and you just need to understand how the apply them to the relevant models.

Admin:
1. We would need to agree on the make-up date for Week 03 as it falls on a public holiday.
2. You should have already formed your teams and decide on a data set to work on.
3. We will be starting on the lab for Spotfire. Please ensure your software and licences are in order.
